# Dataset of 10,000 Modern Decks for Magic: the Gathering
A dataset of 9,963 user-created modern decks. Decks were scraped from deckstats.net on December 27, 2020. These decks were uploaded by random users, so there is no guarantee that the decks are competetive - but there is a wider variety since some archetypes never see competetive play.

(Note: commas were removed from card names)
